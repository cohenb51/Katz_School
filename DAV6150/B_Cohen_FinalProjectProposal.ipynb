No matter the cause, people write articles so that people will read them. It is of interest then to structure articles in ways that maximize the number of readers.\n",

A model like this could help optimize what title the article should have, and what day the article should be released in order to maximize the number of shares. \n"

    "Knowing the answer to this is particularly important when it comes to writing articles. Some newspapers are often accused of being too liberal or conservative.

If this is true, it might be rethinking how we teach things in school. Is it worth it to present biased opinions in order to keep children engaged? Now our dataset won't extend to tell us anything about children but we could extend our research to look at children articles. More directly though, it should raise questions about people who criticize social media for being biased. If this is the nature of what people read, can we really criticize them?"

Naturally, a title that catches a person's eye is more likely to be read. It is unclear though, at least to me, whether people would be more attracted to shorter or longer titles. Longer titles may be able to include more information but shorter titles may be easier to quickly read. \n",

Do we have any outliers or null values? Do we have multi-collinearity? Are some of our features irrelevant? What is the distribution of our target variable?\n",

    "1. Do people tend to read articles with titles that are more 'polar' (ie - not objective).\n",

    "For this we could use correlation metrics (r2) with the shares variable. How polar the article is, is given as a field in our dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Are certain articles more likely to be read during certain days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could create plots of number of shares based on days of the week. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we find there is no correlation between any of the questions and the number of shares, we may choose not to include any of them in our model. If there is, depending on the model we could view the effect of the variable in various ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could analyze the coefficients for the geometric models. \n",
    "2. Scikit learn has a permutation feature importance metric which we could use as a way to see if different models are seing the effects of the features the same way. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html\n",
    "3. We could see how our model performs if we remove the features mentioned above in the research questions above and leave the others constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to clean our data. From looking at the columns in our dataset, we already are given dummy variables. We would want to check the scale of our variables and make sure they are consistent. We also may need additional steps depending on our results from the eda.\n",

    "\n",
    "After this we will build different models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a regression problem to predict the number of shares, we may start with basic linear/other geometric models. \n",
    "This is a count model as we are predicting number of shares. I obviously can't say exactly which distribution would fit the data best until doing further eda. I might assume at this point that we should be leaning towards a negative binomial since we would expect there to be a large variation in number of shares but this should be based on our eda and not just an assumption.\n",
    "Could there be negative predictions with other distributions that better fit the data? Possibly yes, and possibly no. We might not have this problem if we have an intercept > 0 and our coefficients are all positive for example. From looking at the data, it doesn't appear that we have rows where the number of shares is around 0. At this point, it is hard to be worried about this case because we can take a log of our target variable to force the number to be positive if we need to. Ideally, the model we choose will actually fit the data and we won't have this problem.\n",
    "If we use a discrete distribution like a negative binomial fractional values won't be an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second model we could use a random forest. The random forest implementation in scikit learn has a feature importance metric which we could use to analyze the importance of each feature. We would have to see which number of trees performs the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 3rd model, we could use a neural net net. http://www.gabormelli.com/RKB/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor  \n",
    "We could try to see how this model does when we keep all the variables and leave 1 out as constant to see the effect of each variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our ensemble models, we could try to combine our best geometric model, random forest, and nueral net. \n",
    "From reading online there are different methods of doing this like like averaging results of the previous models in bagging\n",
    "or iteratively trying to improve the model with boosting. I would rather wait to determine which method to use until we get up to this in class but since all of the above models are built independently it would make more sense to average the results with bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will evaluate our models. In this case we should use RMSE as our cost metric since we want to see how far away our values are from the true number of shares. \n",
