No matter the cause, people write articles so that people will read them. It is of interest then to structure articles in ways that maximize the number of readers.\n",

At the same time though, we would have access to almost all of the other features mentioned in the dataset. A model like this could help optimize what title the article should have, and what day the article should be released in order to maximize the number of shares. \n"

    "Knowing the answer to this is particularly important when it comes to writing articles. Some newspapers are often accused of being too liberal or conservative. Part of the reason they may be doing this is to keep their readers happy. It would therefore be interesting to know if it is possible to keep readers happy while writing objective articles. \n",

    "This answer could also help answer questions about human psychology. We may be more interested in reading things that are interesting over knowing facts. If this is true, it might be rethinking how we teach things in school. Is it worth it to present biased opinions in order to keep children engaged? Now our dataset won't extend to tell us anything about children but we could extend our research to look at children articles. More directly though, it should raise questions about people who criticize social media for being biased. If this is the nature of what people read, can we really criticize them?"

Naturally, a title that catches a person's eye is more likely to be read. It is unclear though, at least to me, whether people would be more attracted to shorter or longer titles. Longer titles may be able to include more information but shorter titles may be easier to quickly read. \n",
