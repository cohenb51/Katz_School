In the notebook in this folder we will visualize some of the data in the Housing Maintenance Code Violations 
found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5

The data describes several housing violations found in NY and provides details including where the incident was,
(broken down by boro, and address), how severe it was (broken down into 3 classes, A,B,C where A is least severe 
and C the most severe)
