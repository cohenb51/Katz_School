In the notebook in this folder we will visualize some of the data in the Housing Maintenance Code Violations 
found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5

The data describes several housing violations found in NY and provides details including where the incident was,
(broken down by boro, and address), how severe it was (broken down into 3 classes, A,B,C where A is least severe 
and C the most severe)

We aggregate the data to find how long each boro takes to close incidents, from start to finish. 
We should later see if the differences in time to resolve incidents is 'significant'
