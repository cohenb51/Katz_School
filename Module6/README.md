This notebook was created for Module 6 in the Analytics programming class

In the Phishing notebok, we analyze a dataset which looks at urls and website source code to see if a website is phishing or not.
We find that certain features assumed to be telling of phishing don't reveal much.
 
Not using https seems to be the most important feature to look at, being highly present
in sights that are secure, but only present in a few phishing site. 


In the second notebook we look at precipitation data from the month of September in 2019.
We found that most states seemed to have more precipitation than normal
with the biggest difference in Barrow, AK with around 2.67 times more.
