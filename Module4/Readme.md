## Water Consumption Analysis with Numpy

I'm Benny Cohen and have created this notebook as part of Module 4 of the Katz school Analytics Progrmaming Course.

In this notebook I do basic numpy operations to analyze a csv file containing information about water consumption by residents of New York. 

The data set contains info about...
The year
The population of New York during that year
The amount of water consumed during that year
The gallons per person consumed. 

More info data can be found https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m

This notebook contains both the csv file and the notebook analysing it.
