In the notebook in this folder we will look at some of the data in the Housing Maintenance Code Violations 
found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5

The data describes several housing violations found in NY and provides details including where the incident was,
(broken down by boro, and address), how severe it was (broken down into 3 classes, A,B,C where A is least severe 
and C the most severe)

Here we try to find whether there is any significant difference in months that incidents were first observed during inspections..
We find that in 2014 significantly less incidents were opened in November although in recent years most 
incidents were opened during the fall.
