In the notebook in this folder we will visualize some of the data in the Housing Maintenance Code Violations 
found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5

The data describes several housing violations found in NY and provides details including where the incident was,
(broken down by boro, and address), how severe it was (broken down into 3 classes, A,B,C where A is least severe 
and C the most severe)

We find that most incidents are medium severity (ranked B) and that there are very few incidents from Staten
Island and a lot from Brooklyn. We also find several incidents that took a really long time to 
resolve. (over 10000 days!)
